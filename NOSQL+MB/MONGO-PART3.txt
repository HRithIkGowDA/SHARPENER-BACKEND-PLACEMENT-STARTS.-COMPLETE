1. What are some of the advantages of MongoDB?
Some of the advantages of MongoDB include:



Document-oriented storage: MongoDB uses a document-based data model, which allows for more flexible and dynamic data structures.


Scalability: MongoDB can easily scale horizontally by adding more servers, making it well-suited for applications with large amounts of data and high user traffic.


Performance: MongoDB uses an index-based data access model, which provides fast and efficient data retrieval.


Rich query language: MongoDB supports a rich query language that allows you to perform complex data manipulation and analysis operations.


High availability: MongoDB provides built-in support for replica sets, which allow for automatic failover and high availability.




2. What is a Document in MongoDB?


In MongoDB, a Document is a basic unit of data that is stored in a collection. A document is a set of key-value pairs, where the keys represent field names and the values represent the data stored in those fields. Documents are similar to rows in a traditional relational database.



3. What are Databases in MongoDB?


In MongoDB, a Database is a container for collections, which in turn hold the documents. A single MongoDB instance can host multiple databases, each with its own collections and documents





4. How do you Scale up MongoDB to handle millions of users? (This can impress interviewers)
(Sharding and indexing are two common concepts used here)



To handle millions of users in MongoDB, you can scale the system horizontally by adding more servers. This can be achieved using the following strategies:



Sharding: Sharding involves splitting the data across multiple servers, which allows you to distribute the load and improve performance.


Replication: Replication involves creating multiple copies of the data, which provides increased reliability and availability.


Indexing: Indexing is the process of creating an index on a specific field in the documents, which can improve the speed of data retrieval operations.
