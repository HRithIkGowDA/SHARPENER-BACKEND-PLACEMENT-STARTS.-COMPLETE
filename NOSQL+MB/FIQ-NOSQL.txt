Favourite interview question-NOSQL




1)answer the difference between NOSQL and SQL.



The main difference between SQL and NoSQL is the way that data is stored and organized.



SQL (Structured Query Language) is a traditional, relational database management system that uses a fixed schema and stores data in tables with rows and columns. This means that each row in the table represents a single record, and each column represents a specific data element for that record. The data is highly organized and easily searchable, making SQL a popular choice for data that requires a high level of structure and organization, such as financial records and customer information.



NoSQL (Not Only SQL) refers to a non-relational, document-oriented database management system that uses a flexible schema and stores data in a more unstructured way, often using JSON or BSON (Binary JSON) documents. This means that each document in a NoSQL database can contain different fields, making it easier to store complex, hierarchical data structures. NoSQL databases are often used for large-scale, data-intensive applications that require fast read and write performance, such as social media and gaming.



2) When will you use SQL and when will you use NOSql. Explain with example.



When to use SQL:

When you have a large amount of structured data that requires a fixed schema, such as financial records, customer information, or sales data.


When you need to enforce data integrity, such as enforcing unique constraints or referential integrity.


When you need to run complex queries, such as aggregating data or joining multiple tables.


Example: A banking application that needs to store customer information and transactions in a highly organized and structured way, using SQL would be an appropriate choice.



When to use NoSQL:



When you have a large amount of unstructured or semi-structured data, such as user-generated content, sensor data, or log files.


When you need fast read and write performance, such as in real-time, data-intensive applications like social media and gaming.


When you need to scale your database horizontally, by adding more nodes to the database cluster, without downtime or loss of data.


Example: A social media application that needs to store large amounts of unstructured data, such as posts, comments, and likes, in a flexible and scalable way, using NoSQL would be an appropriate choice.
