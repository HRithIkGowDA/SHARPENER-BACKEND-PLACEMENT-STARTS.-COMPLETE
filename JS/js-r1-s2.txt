Javascript Round 1 - SET 2-Solutions




1) what is process.nextTick ?



process.nextTick is a method in Node.js that adds a callback function to the next iteration of the event loop. It is often used to defer non-blocking operations and to give priority to more urgent tasks.





2) how can you check if a variable is an array?



You can check if a variable is an array in JavaScript by using the Array.isArray() method.



let arr = [1, 2, 3];

console.log(Array.isArray(arr)); // true





3) Do You know Sql ? What is difference between truncate and delete?



Yes, I know SQL. The difference between TRUNCATE and DELETE in SQL is that TRUNCATE is used to delete all the data in a table and reset the auto-increment counter, while DELETE is used to delete specific rows from a table. TRUNCATE is faster and more efficient than DELETE because it only needs to deallocate data pages and does not require logging the deletion of each row.







4) Do you have any about indexing the table ?



Indexing is a way to optimize the performance of a database by creating an index for the data in a table. An index is a data structure that allows quick search and retrieval of rows in a table. Indexes are stored separately from the actual data, and the database software uses them to quickly locate the rows that match a search criteria. In SQL, you can create an index on a table using the CREATE INDEX statement.
